# ZUMA-GAME-ASM
This project recreates the classic Zuma game in Assembly language. It features 360-degree frog movement, spiral ball motion, collision detection, and retro ASCII art. Fully keyboard-responsive, it offers smooth gameplay and efficient design. The project showcases low-level programming, optimizing memory, input handling, and graphics rendering.

## Controls  
- Use **W A S D** to move the shooter and aim the ball.  
- Press the **Spacebar** to shoot the ball.  
- Press **P** to pause the game.  

## Gameplay  
1. The shooter fires balls at the moving chain of balls.  
2. Match three or more balls of the same color to remove them from the chain.  
3. Prevent the chain from reaching the goal to avoid losing a life.  
4. Special power-ups may appear to aid your progress.  

## Scoring  
- Points are awarded for each ball removed from the chain.  
- Earn combo bonuses by clearing multiple balls at once.  
- Receive bonus points for completing levels or clearing the entire chain.  

## Game Over  
1. If the chain reaches the goal, you lose a life.  
2. The game ends when all three lives are lost.  

## Getting Started  
### Requirements  
- An Assembly-compatible emulator or hardware.  
- Assembler tools (MASM, NASM, or TASM).  

### Running the Game  
1. Compile the source code using your assembler tool.  
2. Load the compiled program into your emulator or compatible environment.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play!  

## Credits  
This project demonstrates low-level programming concepts, including collision detection, input handling, and graphics rendering, while delivering a fun and nostalgic gaming experience.
